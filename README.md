## 🎲 About

Fit&Quests is a fitness app project in early development that aims to bring D&D-style gamification to workouts.

🚧 **CURRENT STATE**: Basic user authentication system (signup, login, profile) with foundational data structures for future D&D class-based fitness programs.

� **FUTURE VISION**: Weekly exercise programs with boss fights, but this is not yet implemented in the user interface.

## ⚠️ Important Notice - AI-Generated Exercise Programs

> **⚠️ ATTENTION**: The exercise programs in this app have been generated by artificial intelligence as part of the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) development.
>
> **IMPORTANT**: These exercises have not been validated by a professional fitness coach or medical professional.
>
> **🔮 Future Roadmap**:
>
> - Consultation with certified fitness professionals
> - Medical validation of exercises and modifications
> - Advanced personalization based on user profiles
> - Progressive programs adapted to fitness levels
>
> In the meantime, these programs provide a consistent gamified experience with D&D themes to test the concept and functionality. **Please exercise caution and consult a healthcare professional before starting any fitness program.**

## 🎮 Planned System Architecture

### Data Structures Ready (Not Yet Used)

The foundation for D&D class programs exists in the codebase:

```typescript
// Example: Bard Weekly Program
{
  id: 'weekly_bard',
  name: 'College of Valor Training',
  dndClass: 'Bard',
  description: 'Versatile training that inspires your party',
  difficulty: 'Intermediate',
  weeklyWorkouts: [
    // 3 themed workout days
  ],
  bossChallenge: {
    name: 'The Grand Performance',
    description: 'Epic performance battle',
    requiredCompletionRate: 80,
    xpReward: 500
  },
  totalXPReward: 1185
}
```

### Boss Fight System

After completing all weekly workouts, face an epic boss challenge:

- **Themed Battles**: Each class has unique boss encounters
- **Performance Metrics**: Completion rate and time tracking
- **Multiple Attempts**: Try again to improve your score
- **Epic Rewards**: Substantial XP for defeating bosses

### Health Modifications & Accessibility

All exercises include modifications for common limitations:

- **Knee Issues**: Low-impact alternatives and reduced intensity
- **Shoulder Issues**: Modified upper body movements
- **Progressive Scaling**: Adjust difficulty based on user level

## 🔧 Current Development Status

### ✅ What Actually Works Now

- **🔐 Authentication System**: Signup, login, logout with PIN security
- **💱 User Profiles**: Basic profile display with favorite class selection
- **🗄️ Data Models**: TypeScript interfaces for future features
- **📏 Storage Layer**: Encrypted AsyncStorage ready for user data
- **🛣️ Navigation**: Tab-based navigation between screens

### 🚧 What's Missing (Major Features)

- **🏋️ Workout Sessions**: No exercise interface implemented yet
- **🎮 Gamification**: XP, levels, boss fights not connected to UI
- **📈 Progress Tracking**: No real workout tracking in the app
- **🤼 Class Programs**: D&D classes exist as data only, no workout flow
- **🔥 Boss Fights**: Completely planned but not implemented

### 📋 Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create workout session UI**: Connect exercise data to user interface
2. **Implement class selection flow**: Let users actually start programs
3. **Add basic exercise tracking**: Timer, reps, completion
4. **Build XP calculation**: Real-time feedback during workouts
5. **Design boss fight interface**: Epic challenges after weekly completion
